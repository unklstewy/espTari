# Appendix D: Requirements for evidence closure before claiming 100%

**Purpose:** Define proof requirements to upgrade inferred/revision-specific behavior to verified status.

Before claiming 100% compatibility, each [I] and [R] item must be promoted to measured profile behavior by:

1. Capturing hardware traces on representative boards/chip revisions.
2. Running regression corpus with timing-signature comparison.
3. Recording profile-specific deltas in versioned documentation.
4. Locking deterministic replay hashes for each test configuration.
