# 3) Component-by-component specification table

**Purpose:** Define required modeling details and timing obligations for each hardware component.

| Component name | Real hardware part/chip | Function | Clock/timing domain | Bus interactions | Registers/state that must be modeled | Interrupts/exceptions generated/consumed | DMA/arbitration effects | Cycle-accuracy requirements | Model variants | Common emulation pitfalls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
