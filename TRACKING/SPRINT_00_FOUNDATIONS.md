# Sprint 0 - Foundations (Setup Sprint)

Duration: 2 working days  
Goal: Establish execution system, contracts baseline, and acceptance flow.

## Sprint outcome

- Tracking system in place for blended Kanban/Sprint operation.
- Initial API and architecture contracts aligned.
- Product Owner acceptance workflow active.

## Committed tasks

- T-001: Finalize v2 API schema baseline

## Deliverables

- Stable task board and sprint artifacts in TRACKING folder
- Baseline API and implementation-plan alignment pass
- Acceptance log initialized

## Exit criteria

1. Sprint board is active and usable by agent team.
2. T-001 accepted by Product Owner.
3. Sprint 1 ready queue is populated and dependency-valid.

## Risks

- Scope creep into implementation before contract freeze.

Mitigation:

- No engineering task starts without API/acceptance criteria attached.
