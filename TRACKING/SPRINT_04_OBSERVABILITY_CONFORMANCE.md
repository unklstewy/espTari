# Sprint 4 - Observability and Conformance

Duration: 3 working days  
Goal: Harden observability, finalize conformance evidence, and complete release acceptance for Atari ST baseline.

## Committed tasks

- T-020: Register snapshot + stream
- T-021: Bus/memory filtered stream
- T-022: Stream backpressure telemetry

## Sprint demo scenarios

1. Live register stream and snapshots from selected components.
2. Filtered bus/memory stream with deterministic timestamps.
3. Backpressure behavior under simulated slow subscribers.
4. End-to-end acceptance checklist walk-through.

## Stretch tasks

- T-023: Conformance evidence harness
- T-024: Acceptance review pack

## Acceptance criteria

1. Observability endpoints are stable and filter-correct.
2. Backpressure counters and health metrics are accurate.
3. Conformance pack is complete and reviewable.
4. Product Owner signs off Atari ST milestone.

## Evidence package

- Stream validation report
- Backpressure stress report
- Conformance checklist with pass/fail evidence
- Final acceptance decision
